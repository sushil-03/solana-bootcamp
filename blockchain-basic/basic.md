# What is Blockchain?

**Book Definition**: Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that allows for secure and transparent record-keeping. It is a decentralized system that enables multiple parties to access the same information while ensuring the integrity and security of the data.

**Understanding**: Blockchain is a distributed database with unique features.

## Key Features of Blockchain

- **Distributed**: No single authority controls the data; it is distributed across all participants.
- **Immutable**: Once data is added to the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted.
- **Transparent**: All participants can view all the data in the blockchain.
- **Secure**: The data in the blockchain is secure and cannot be tampered with.
- **Open**: Anyone can join the network and participate.

## Additional Benefits

- **Censorship Resistance**: Anyone can make payments on the blockchain, and no entity can stop or reverse those transactions. The transactions are irreversible, and the blockchain itself stores all the transactions. _(Ledger: A ledger is a record of all the transactions that have occurred in the blockchain.)_
- **Fungibility**: Assets on the blockchain can be exchanged without any issues.
- **Decentralization**: No single authority controls the data; it is distributed across all participants. Data is stored on each participant's device.

## Basic Blockchains

### Bitcoin

Bitcoin is a digital currency created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. It is a decentralized currency not controlled by any government or financial institution.

### Ethereum

Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that execute exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party interference.

#### Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain. They automate the execution of agreements or transactions without intermediaries. Unlike APIs, which are invoked by requests, smart contracts are triggered by instructions and send data to the blockchain instead of responses.

#### Solidity

Solidity is a programming language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum. It is similar to JavaScript and is used to create smart contracts.

### Solana

Solana is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that execute exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party interference.

#### How Solana Differs from Ethereum

- **Speed and Cost**: Solana is faster, cheaper, and more scalable than Ethereum.
- **Programming Language**: Solana uses its own programming language called Rust.
- **Consensus Algorithm**: Solana employs a unique consensus algorithm called Proof of History (PoH), while Ethereum uses Proof of Work (PoW).
